  "about-text-top": "Hi! My name is Frankie Qiang and I like building things for the software. Originally from Fujian Province, China. After graduating from the Department of Information Engineering at Putian University in China in 2016, I joined Livemax in Japan. I was involved in the renovation of a rental management system for a major real estate company and the new development of a hotel chain's accommodation reservation system. I was involved in upstream processes from requirements definition to design, development, and testing, gaining perspective and experience on the entire system. In 2018, I moved to Okinawa, where his wife's parents live, and joined my current company mid-career. After getting married, I came into contact with Okinawa's traditional culture and experienced the Japanese value of placing importance on family. I has experience and management skills that transcend phases. After that, I was forced to resign from his previous job due to the global spread of the new coronavirus, and has been working as a freelancer since recovering from his illness.",
